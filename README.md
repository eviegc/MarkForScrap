# MarkForScrap

A Risk of Rain 2 mod that allows you to mark items in your inventory that will be automagically scrapped the next time you use a scrapper.

The goal with this mod is to be as close to vanilla behaviour as possible while introducing the convenience of pre-selecting items you want to scrap.

The vanilla scrapper logic still runs - your item is sucked out of your inventory, the animation plays, and it spits out your scrap - the mod simply circumvents the selection window if you already have pre-selected items.

Note: **This mod requires both server-side and client-side installation.**
