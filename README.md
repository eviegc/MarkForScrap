# MarkForScrap

A mod that allows you to select items from your inventory that will be automagically scrapped the next time you use a scrapper.

Works just like a regular scrapper, except the item to scrap is read from your inventory rather than the selection UI. Falls back to the selection UI in the case you have no pre-selected items.

**This mod requires both server-side and client-side installation**
